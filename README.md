# hello-world
Just starting working with github.

I'm a law student already, but very interested in new technology and IT world.
I've started to code in html, css and javascript first, still learning features of CSS. In february 2015 I want to start learning Ruby.
I'm 21 and developing as an artist, coder, human. :)
